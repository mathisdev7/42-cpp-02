![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/fBtNwQS/image.png)

## Project Description
The `CPP Module 02` expands on the previous modules by introducing ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the canonical form of classes. This module is crucial for understanding how to make C++ code more flexible and efficient using advanced object-oriented programming techniques.

## Journey
This module was an engaging challenge, as it required applying object-oriented principles more extensively. I successfully completed it on my first attempt, demonstrating a solid understanding of operator overloading and class structures.

## Key Learnings
- Ad-hoc polymorphism through operator overloading
- Understanding the canonical form of C++ classes
- Implementing constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators
- Deepening knowledge of object-oriented design principles

## Technical Details
- Developed classes that implement overloaded operators for arithmetic and comparison operations.
- Ensured proper memory management when overloading operators.
- Applied best practices to maintain consistency in class design.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Success
- **Completion Time**: 1 day per module

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring proper handling of memory in overloaded operators.
- Implementing all required special member functions correctly.
- Understanding the importance of the canonical form for maintainability.

## Reflection
This module reinforced the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and efficient C++ code. Understanding operator overloading and the canonical form of classes helped improve my approach to object-oriented programming, making future projects easier to manage.

## Skills Developed
- Operator overloading and ad-hoc polymorphism
- Canonical class form implementation
- Object-oriented design improvements
- Memory management in class structures
- Debugging and ensuring proper resource allocation
